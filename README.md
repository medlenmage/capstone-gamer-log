# Gamer Log

## Description
---
This is a project that was made to encapsulate all knowledge learned for frontend web development. It utilizes React, Sass, and javascript.

This app is intended to be a journal/log for gamers who play singleplayer(story driven) based games. It is so for when they finish playing each time they can log what that did after playing they so if they were to put the game down for an extended period of times(days, weeks, months) they can refer back to the journal/log entries for that particular game to rememebr plot points and/or paticular controls of the game. This is a full CRUD app meaning you can add a game and add logs to it as well as update them and delete them. This app uses google authentication so you can store your own collection of games and logs without others interfering with them or you having to filter through everyone elses.
